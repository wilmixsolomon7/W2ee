  "body": "# W2ee\r\n=======\r\n\r\nW2EE is about WEBC part2 of WEBC Programming Language invented by wilmix jemin j at year 2016.\r\n\r\nWEBC part2 consists of two modules\r\n\r\na) WEBC Part2 -module 1 for java\r\n\r\nb) WEBC Part2 -module 2 for C/C++.\r\n\r\nW2ee has userfriendly framework called as\r\n\r\nJAUF.\r\n\r\nand it has latest frameworks like\r\n\r\nJC , Jeb, JShell, JSync, ODollar, Oplus,\r\n\r\nWHTML, Petal, VJAVA, VSLASH ,and GJAVA.\r\n\r\nW2ee use all these Latest P.L\r\n\r\nfor mobile and P.L like\r\n\r\nJSAUCER with WEBC. SO WEBC is called as\r\n\r\na \"SKY Programming Language\".\r\n\r\nDifferences Between W2ee and JSAUCER\r\n\r\nwhen to use?\r\n\r\n1) WEBC is used and it permits it's latest\r\n\r\nFrameworks and other native P.L like\r\n\r\nC++, .Net, etc.\r\n\r\nHence we call WEBC as an Interactive P.L.\r\n\r\n2) JSaucer never permits and it is used only\r\n\r\nwith mobile remotewebapplication with\r\n\r\nmobile phones like Android.\r\n\r\n3) One who learn JSaucer has depth knowledge\r\n\r\nwith mobile remotewebapplication.\r\n\r\nTHE LIST OF Latest Framework and Programming Language belong to W2ee part2 or interact with J$\r\n\r\nwith Merits\r\n\r\n1) JAUF -> Userfriendly and GUI Design\r\n\r\n2) JSLASH -> As a AutoGenerated compiler with in a limited amount of time.\r\n\r\n3) JEEWEB -> used for enterprise\r\n\r\n4) JSHELL -> used with linux\r\n\r\n5) JSYNC -> Async enterprise Programming used with JEEWEB\r\n\r\n6) Odollar -> Simillar to Jdk1.7 features\r\n\r\n7)Oplus -> Used in Indian It sector.\r\n\r\n8) Tdollar -> can be used as a helper Frameworks of WEBC to eliminate WEBC demerits.\r\n\r\n9) Wsharp -> contains shortest statements and utilities\r\n\r\nIt is the best Programming language which interact with W2ee.\r\n\r\n10) Petal -> It is used with VJAVA, JAVA, WEBC professionals\r\n\r\n11) WPLUS -> Attractive Indian latest Programming Language\r\n\r\n12) VSlASH -> SIMILLAR to struts -spring orm Framework\r\n\r\n13) GJAVA -> Used with google P.L\r\n\r\n14) WHTML -> Used with WEBC and HTML\r\n\r\n15) VJAVA -> Simillar to Jdk1.6 Features.\r\n\r\n16) ADollar -> It is used in Advanced Business and A$ is used to interact with W2ee.\r\n\r\n17) UW2ee => it is an american and U.k Programming Language based on W2ee used in American and U.k sector.\r\n\r\n18) BHTML and CSP => it is an Banking Programming Language invented in W2ee.\r\n\r\n19) WEBCREmote => it is an one minute Automation W2ee Advanced P.L for creating remoteserver.\r\n\r\n20) WEBCJSLASH => it is an one minute Automation W2ee Advanced P.L\r\n\r\n21) SAP =>interaction with sap P.L\r\n\r\n22) PHY=> Interaction with phython P.L.\r\n\r\n23) W2ee Advanced Business =>  W2ee Advanced  Business  is  used   with  W2ee(webc-part2).\r\n\r\n",
